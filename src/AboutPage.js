<h1> Our Mission </h1>
<p> Would you go to a restaurant if all the reviews mentioned how cold the place was? Or that it was full of mice? Or that at the end of your meal your waiter tried to charge you extra because your plate was dirty? - The answer is almost definitely no, and why should you? </p>
<p>We expect a certain standard of quality with everything we buy. However, this doesn’t seem to apply to the private renting sector. </p>
<p> The average age of a first-time buyer in the UK is currently <a href="https://www.finder.com/uk/first-time-buyer-statistics#:~:text=right%20for%20you.-,Quick%20overview,in%202019%20was%20%C2%A346%2C200." target="_blank"> 34 years old</a>. This is six years older than the average in 2007 and means that more and more people are relying on privately rented accommodation for housing for a lot longer than they used to. This increased demand has helped to drive rent prices up to astronomic proportions, with average rents in London alone rising by over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/291787/average-mean-weekly-rent-of-private-renters-in-england-uk-y-on-y/#:~:text=Between%202008%20and%202021%2C%20the,pounds%20to%20201%20British%20pounds." target="_blank"> 25%</a> since 2012.</p>
<p> However, despite this growing cash flow, the private rental sector is responsible for some of the worst housing in the country. In 2019 it was estimated that <a href ="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7328/#:~:text=The%20PRS%20has%20the%20worst%20housing%20conditions&text=The%20English%20Housing%20Survey%20(EHS,%25%20of%20social%2Drented%20homes." target= '_blank'>23%</a> of all privately rented homes failed to meet the government’s own Decent Homes Standards, nearly double the figure for socially rented housing. This means that they have at least one serious health hazard and are legally unfit for human habitation.</p>
<p> This classification does nothing to consider the general malpractice by landlords that many private tenants endure. This could include neglecting to fix persistent issues, unnecessary deductions from damage deposits, imposing restrictions on their lifestyles and more.</p>
<p> Despite all this, British renters still have comparatively few rights when compared with their landlords. They are contractually bound to pay full rent prices in unliveable housing, the legal processes available to them are bureaucratic and ineffective, they live at the mercy of their landlords and are routinely mis sold promises before moving in to new accommodation. This is where Rent Flag comes in.</p>
<p> Our mission is simple: Provide tenants with a place to hold dodgy landlords to account and inform others like them of the realities of life in rental properties that they might be looking to move in to. </p>
<p> By sharing our experiences in an informative, collaborative way, we can help level the playing field by helping each other make informed housing decisions, holding those responsible for poor quality housing to account, and generally improving the quality of rented accommodation around the country.</p>
